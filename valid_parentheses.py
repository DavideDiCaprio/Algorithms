'''
In this exercise you are going to implement the function are_parentheses_valid(s)
which takes as input a string that contains any combination of the following two
chatacters: '(', ')' and returns True if the parentheses are valid, False otherwise.

Note: assume there are NO other characters than '(', ')' in the input string.

A string of parentheses s, is valid if and only if, for each open parentheses '(',
there is a corresponding closing parentheses ')', and vice versa. If a closing
parenthesis is unmatched by an opening one, or an opening one is not matched by a
closing parentheses, then the string is not valid.

Examples:
'()' -> valid
'(' -> not valid
'(()' -> not valid
'(())' -> valid
'((())())' -> valid
'((())()))' -> not valid.

To solve this exercise, start by implementing the test function. Once you are
satisfied with the test, move on to the implementation of the main function.
